/**
 * ByteBufferBackedOutputStream serves two purposes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>It allows a ByteBuffer to be the source of data for OutputStream-based
 * callers
 * <li>It expands the underlying buffer to accommodate incoming data
 * </ol>
 * This class is used to interface with callers using "classic" java.io.* APIs.
 * This OutputStream provides the means to grow the buffer on demand as more
 * data is written by those callers. For code that manages the
 * ByteBufferBackedOutputStream, there are accessor methods for the underlying
 * buffer as the object reference passed into the constructor is changed upon
 * expansion. Additionally, some callers might wish to "un-expand" the buffer
 * back to a more reasonable size after use.
